Sharon's Hello World repository

Hi Humans!

Well, from one human to another - Hi Fellow Humans and Not-Really-Humans.

Hubot here. I like Node.js and Coffeescript (that's what I'm made of!).
I've had tacos on the moon and find them far superior to Earth tacos.

I also like create Other Worlds.

But I digress. These changes are all about creating a Hello World script using GitHub.
